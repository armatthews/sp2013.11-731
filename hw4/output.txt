amendment гудлата - just one of the 68 constitutional amendments , affecting a wide range of issues , that were made in this meeting .
there are at least 15 versions of a balanced budget amendments only in the house of representatives and how much else about the " controlling federal spending . "
the budget control act , which was held in august , and demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted for a balanced budget amendment .

amendment banning same - sex marriage offer for many years , as well as another , banning burning the flag .
as or sought to members of congress to propose amendments , they are not faster than in past years .

entirely different experiences illustrate the uneasy relationship that developed between the army and often indifferent , sometimes in us audience .
" we are not victims , " said brigadier general sean b. mcfarland , who commanded the forces in iraq , and soon went to afghanistan .
this is a very sensitive topic for commanders , who do not want to seem ungrateful or objecting with society , which they serve .
as a result , most talk about the pity is quietly and only between combat veterans .
some will look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and were in exotic places .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible for work in washington immediately after the military campaign .
uneasy , that have the military , partly comes from the us indifference to the wars .
" we , as the nation , no longer appreciate military heroism , as it was quite usually in world war ii , " says david бэрноу , retired lieutenant - general who commanded the american forces in afghanistan .

its strategy : instead , to collect all of the plaintiffs in this case , put all your eggs in one basket , so to speak , " she will open up many things , if necessary , to maintain the pressure .
court documents , which was newsweek , the strategy is basically a protection that the former or current soldiers cannot claims to the army for damage incurred by in the armed forces .
" the supposed damage refers to risk , присущему military service , of the plaintiffs , " said the documents .
and in iraq and afghanistan women 's team - soldiers play an increasingly important role , especially in contacts with local women in combat zone .

between them and the verdict stands the doctrine , which criticized since then , as it appeared .
army lagged for decades , because it does not have those incentives and restraining funds , which imposes responsibility .
these things will change only to back then , when good people will want to to fight .
" we will continue to fight the army on the issue , until the reforms , " she says .
on monday , breivik , suspected of committing mass killings in norway in july , which has killed 77 people , was on his first open the hearing .
after the summer of the tragedy the researchers wanted to to learn more about these people .
supply of personal data on facebook is so great , " says bartlett , the researchers could easily use the site 's advertising tool , to highlight the demographic group with scientific precision - that marketers and for several years already .
with facebook bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants 14 extreme right - wing parties in 11 european countries - not even out of office .
some results are not so striking : online - supporters of right - wing groups - often young and male , dissatisfied with the immigration .
work demos - just one example of how facebook became a new popular tool in the hands of researchers .
with more than 800 million active users , add an average of three records in the day , " super - hot information " facebook is research boom , increasing the number of scientific papers with the name of the site in the title on the 800 % over the past five years .
" before , if you want to interview people from the british national party , would have been very difficult to identify them . "
" facebook does this is all - you to contact him directly . "
recent research by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on facebook , were much more at risk for alcoholism , than students who were silent on this issue .
" you ca n't solve the problem , not выявив its , " told the washington post димитри христакис moreno , co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development in children 's research institute for seattle .
facebook also constantly pulls all sorts of data about its users .
but facebook users know that the site is watching them , like it or not - for the opportunity to play in скраббл with another , in thousands of miles away from you , the site can handle your personal data .
while researchers have a strictly defined rules for offline - research , online data .
" as far as they imagined , it was only between them and their friends . "
even offline there is no guarantee that the object research very honest .
" what you say on facebook , and the fact that you do outside of facebook , " two completely different things , " said selwin .
" nothing can replace exit in the real world , and interacting with real people , " he says .
" cold and inhuman " : anders беринг breivik for the first time publicly appears before court

about 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i became a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea that he is part of the " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he is not mad , and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices .
but it is not decreases automatically grief and confusion , which now feels the entire nation .
after the death of steve jobs on 5 october some compared him with henry ford , describing the technical genius as a great inventor of modernity .
he was , of course , a designer , мечтателем and regarded themselves as hippies , but he was also meticulous organizer and modernizer manufacturing process , which believed that many business leaders have suffered from the disease to think that really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] a great idea from the great product separates a huge amount of ingenious labor . "
by the time it took about 10 years since , as jobs from apple , and he already worked out in his new computer company next in anticipation of the mass of the internet .
only after the death of jobs full vhs - copy has been found in the garage of the director .
man known for their hatred of detailed interview , jobs seems to be here unusually prepared to present their technological philosophy and business strategy .
in four different points during the interview there are large intervals between questions and answers - reflection for 10-15 seconds , where jobs are clearly weighing its thoughts to say .
in filmed before the age of пиксара , айподов and айфонов lost interview there is something uncannily prophetic , when jobs estimates that , as he sees , different companies make right and wrong , and offers its own vision for information technology .
he has a vision of how things could and should be .
" during the entire time in the business i constantly asked : " why do you do it ? " and the answers that you invariably get : " oh , it 's just done exactly that . "
by way of recording expenses , often начинавшейся expenditure with the " standard " , which took from the ceiling and then подгонялись with " clarification " , he has created automated structure , which guaranteed that they will be able to track business expenses until the little things .
jobs in detail about " blue box , " which he fewer with steve wozniak , the device , which allowed people to effectively взламывать telephone company and call on the long distances for free .
he says , as he and wozniak tested the box , using the phone - machine gun , when the conversation and then подсоединяясь from one at&t 's network to another , not yet been as much as possible .
" we were young , and all that we have learned is that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
jobs continues to describe one famous escapade , in detail with which he and wozniak almost did , calling the vatican through blue box at midnight and asking to phone the pope , struggling to copy henry kissinger .
about love in the technology ( and cold прозванивании bill хьюлетта ) :
soon after their 20 - minute telephone conversation jobs received a year подработку in hewlett - пакард .
jobs later became one of the hp employees , who visited the company 's research laboratory in palo alto , where he saw " the first desktop computer . "
i often went to the hp as a teenager and revolved around the machine and wrote for her program .
in several places in an interview with jobs says about inventing new products on the fly .
working only 30 days in the credit , he had to think and assembly and delivery of ready - made devices .
" i remember the fierce debate ... they were shouting at me , that it will take five years [ to collect the mouse , which will cost $ 300 ] , and i was fed by the throat , and released , and found the designer " .
" for example , you 're working in ibm or xerox , so you do the best copier and printer , or that ? "
sales and marketing make it more successful , thus [ it is those types of people ] who finally comes to the management companies , and people , making the product of the decision - makers .
he could be ten times more , could be майкрософтом 1990s ...
you need to keep in the head of the 5,000 of ideas - these concepts , " combining them all together ... "
part of what made the famous mac , was that people who worked on him , were musicians , poets , artists , зоологами , historians , who happened to be the best specialists in information technology in the world .
scalia and thomas lunch with the opponents of the health care law , until the court consider the case
this incident took place in the last thursday , when all nine justices met to discuss filed petitions for review .
judges agreed to consider the process ; in fact , rotary debate lasting in the 5 1/2 hours are expected in march 2012 , and the outcome will likely become a hindrance in the presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time , when a court decision .
law firm clement , bancroft pllc , was one of almost two dozen firms , which helped sponsor an annual dinner of federalists , long - existing groups , constantly , conservative legal principles .
another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
was present , among other things , mitch mcconnell , the leader of the republicans in the senate and a well - known opponent of the health care law .
nothing new : two judges visit events company federalists have already been for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as the company with large financial interests , it was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign to raise money with lawyers , which are now viewed in court . "

" so , make such a strong decline , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction of unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" although the military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will become the fastest decline in the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with whom we can live , and this is not an option , that we need to impose ourselves . "

at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be further -- troops with a shell , but without the core .

stories about the fraud on the exams in a school and college - standard thing .
mentors , who should teach the opposite , sends a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
during one of the day , studies have shown that , you may lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth it from this draw the conclusion that liars difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change their position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when responding to a complex question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means , to expose the lies , but to master the skill to detect deception can be .
