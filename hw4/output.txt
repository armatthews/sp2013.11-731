some results are not so striking : online - supporters of right - wing groups - often young and male , dissatisfied with the immigration .

about 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i became a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea that he is part of the " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he 's not a mad , and said that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices .
but it is not decreases automatically grief and confusion , which now feels the entire nation .

nothing new : two judges attend events society federalists for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to companies with big financial interests , was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , which are now viewed in court . "
scalia and thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in groups such as society federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that this is against the judge elena kagan ethical question arises , rather than scalia and thomas .
her critics demanded that kagan refused to hearings on this case , because it was too involved in the protection of the law then , to be impartial now .

" interference with organised crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not only for michoacan , but for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon in радиоинтервью the next day after the sunday vote .
pri ruled mexico 7 decades , until he lost the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , the national action party candidate , or ipa , headed by her brother , refused to recognize the vallejo winner .
ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .

раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must " do everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia may be to some extent protected , but it may not be invulnerable . "
european monetary union has been badly undercut european debt crises in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis spawned fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and reducing foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers on monday in congress , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will cause financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and civilian assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , make such a strong decline , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction of unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" although the military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with whom we can live , and this is not an option , that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for release of the pentagon from cuts , will see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be further -- troops with a shell , but without the core .
" this is a paper tiger , the army with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles , including those which passed the tests , and some only in the early stages of planning .
stopping further development and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that is a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
the administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly made that retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud on exams in school and college - standard thing .
mentors , who should teach the opposite , sends a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
within one day , as studies show that , you can lie 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth it from this draw the conclusion that liars difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change their position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when responding to a complex question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means deception detection , to detect the lies , but to master the skill you can .

in france we have security body , which is edged and transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years nuclear industry has survived three serious incident .
device in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error resulted in the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will lessons from this accident , as learned from the previous two .
as it is all the specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration burden to the french economy and for the french society .
in his program francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of influence of immigrants based on the view that they can replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking reduction in wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most skilled - dynamic sectors , where training is not linked to offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants , leads that the arrival of the immigrants positively affect the salaries of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all based immigrants ) .
according to the world labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their foes , enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a necessary condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once philosopher etienne said вашро .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first of all this political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we are dreaming not edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with it each of its nations .
because only joint work europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt each , free from markets and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a long discussion of this proposal socialists and jacques delors now require all european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , was to " create a " republicans .
this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , this popular eu sovereignty .

" two large organisations in france promised in the future systematically to distribute among their clients ' bank cards , suited for non - use , " said gerard небуи , general manager of visa europe france .

yesterday , crédit agricole announced the experiment from december to june next year in the massacre .
confirmed long предполагавшиеся link between the terrorist group al qaeda in the muslim maghreb ( aqmi ) and nigerian sect boko haram .
" the way in which use these two organizations , and intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperate , " he explained , without going into the details .
among the wreckage left after the operation , french and нигерские investigators found a few phone sim card , belonging to terrorists .
analysis of the calls pointed to several interlocutors , were in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but , certainly , you have to wait for more reliable evidence , before talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by the washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the problems that creates a boko haram .

in august , local representation of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when aqmi has in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram is a new threat to continent .

romney also promised military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to stop its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates showed daunting ignorance of affairs .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
it is very far from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they resemble that obama himself was amateur , and that he had to lower the tone about the fight against terror .
after iraq , it does not believe in military intervention , which confused in the sand .
northern stream , new gate for entering of russian gas to europe .
he is designed on the supplies of natural gas the equivalent of 30 million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and government participated in the last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , new pipeline , which directly connects russia and germany under water .

gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the northern flow , which has been commissioned to build and operate gas pipeline .

gas pipeline construction financing was provided by 30 % shareholders and 70 % of bank loans .
