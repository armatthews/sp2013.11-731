at a hearing in the city council last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said the layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 , said that they have notice of claim , warning department of education that against him filed ; on wednesday , will be held a press conference to announce a formal file a lawsuit in state supreme court in manhattan .

language may sound harmless , but still no discussion on the libya 's was easy .

this measure , proposed a member of the house of representatives bob гудлатом ( republican , virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other , which will be on the plenary vote in congress this convocation .
amendment гудлата is only one of 68 constitutional amendments , affect a wide range of issues , which were introduced in this meeting .

the budget control act , which passed in august , demanded that and the house of representatives and the senate vote for a balanced budget amendment .

amendment banning same - sex marriage offer for many years , and another , as banning flag - burning .

some would look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and have been to exotic places .
still looking for work , he said , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible work in washington immediately after combat tour .
awkwardness , that are military , in part , comes from the american indifference to the wars .

court documents , which got newsweek , the strategy - basically a protection that the current or former soldiers cannot claims for damages incurred by the army in the armed forces .
" the alleged damage refers to risk присущему military service of the plaintiffs , " in the documents said .

" we will continue to fight the army on this issue until will reform , " she says .
on monday , breivik , suspected of committing mass murder in norway in july , which has 77 people dead , appeared at his first public court hearing .
following summer tragedy , researchers want to find out more about these people .
hoard of personal data on facebook is so great , " says bartlett , the researchers could easily use the site 's advertising tool , to highlight the demographic group with scientific precision - that marketers and do for several years .
using facebook bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants of the 14 extreme - right parties in 11 european countries are not even leaving the office .
some of the results are not so striking : online supporters of right - wing groups - often young people , male , disaffected immigration .
demos 's work just one example of how facebook becomes a new popular as a tool in the hands of scientists .
with more than 800 million active users , add an average of three record in the day , " the super - hot information " facebook causes research boom , increasing number of scientific papers with the name of the site in the title by 800 % over the past five years .
" before , and if you want to interview people from the british national party , it would be very hard to identify them . "
" facebook does all that " you get to them directly . "
recent study by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on facebook , were much more at risk for alcoholism than students who were silent on this issue .
" you ca n't solve the problem , not выявив it , " the washington post said димитри христакис moreno , the co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development at the seattle children 's research institute .
facebook also has constantly draws a different type of data about his own users .
but facebook users know that the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - for the opportunity to play in the скраббл other , in thousands of miles away from you , the site can handle your personal data .
while researchers have a strictly defined standards conducting offline - for research , online data .

even offline there 's no guarantee that a research dead honest .
" what you say on facebook , and what you do outside of facebook , are two completely different things , " says the selwin .
" nothing can replace exit into the real world and fellowship with real people , " he said .
" cold and inhuman " : anders беринг breivik is first publicly tried

around 30 survivors and victims ' relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but me personally was a little bit easier , after i saw and heard suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea that he is part of a big " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he was not crazy , and said that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices .
but that does n't automatically reduces grief and confusion , that now feels the entire nation .

it has a vision for how things could be and would have to be .
" throughout the entire time in the business i constantly asked : " why do you do this ? " and the answers you invariably get : " oh , it 's just done it . "
by way of recording costs , often начинавшейся with " standard spending " that took from the ceiling and then подгонялись with " clarification " , he has created automated structure , which ensured that they will be able to track business expenses until the details .

" we were young , and all that we learned is that we could build something , that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
jobs continues to describe one famous escapade , in detail with which he and wozniak almost did , calling the vatican through the blue box in the midnight and asking to phone the pope , struggling to copy henry kissinger .
about the love of technology ( and cold прозванивании bill хьюлетта ) :
jobs soon after their 20 - minute phone conversation was summer подработку at hewlett - пакард .

, the pri ruled mexico for seven decades until lost the presidency in year 2000 .

for the pri , however , no matter how awful look election in michoacan , a victory will give momentum behind the party .
раджат naga , the managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must " do everything they can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia it can be protected to some extent , but it cannot be immune . "
the monetary union was badly undermined europe 's debt crisis in the past months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis spawned fears that he can bring the global economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's commerce minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and a reduction in foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious challenges , and we need to maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that developing economies like india makes no sense to help wealthy europeans , when they face from their own deep economic problems .
" at some point , they know that the greeks are retiring in 50 years to come and go on holidays to the sea , and it wo n't be seen well , " he said .
mr. knag says that the eurozone crisis threatened by " significant direct consequences " across asia .
he said that vulnerable emerging markets need to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from the downturn and significant capital оттоков out of their economies .
defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the impact of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona , and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , would make such a strong reduction , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction of unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine trust with those who supports our army and will seriously damage combat readiness " .
" while the military funding in the overseas contingency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff personnel will be reduced , leading to опозданиям with the payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will be quick decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not a solution , which we can live with , and it is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or the recent warnings from senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for release of the pentagon from reductions that will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with a shell , but without kernel .
" it 's a paper tiger , army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks at the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles , including those who have already been testing and some only early stages of planning .
stopping further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that is a vital next step to improve and confront potential threats china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lie in daily life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged with лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly hide that a retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged with in the financial fraud during the campaign , connected to укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors , which must be taught the opposite , sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
in a day , as studies show that , you may lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that total strangers солгали nearly three times in the first 10 minutes of contact with each other .
in contrast to the game room , similar to , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to detect lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
should not to conclude from this that liars difficult to see and difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , exploring the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which can easily learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or governance .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , while women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lie to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe per asphyxia , laugh , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , or change their position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a difficult issue entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering a difficult question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... how much i know . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lies , but the skill detecting deception can be .

draft statement prepared by the minister olga sanchez кордеро , offered to declare the decree unconstitutional , because the regulation of the radio and television programmes , right , enshrined in law for the federal telecommunications commission ( cofetel ) , in violation of principles of hierarchical subordination and legal reserves .
on this argument and the senate , and the chamber of deputies held two constitutional debate , to refute the decree and to support the complaint , the minister sanchez кордеро suspended the application of the decree and all actions , the it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting .
