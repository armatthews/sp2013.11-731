amendment гудлата - just one of the 68 constitutional amendments , affecting a wide range of issues , that were made in this meeting .
there are at least 15 versions of a balanced budget amendments only in the house of representatives and how much else about the " controlling federal spending . "
the budget control act , which was held in august , and demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted for a balanced budget amendment .

amendment banning same - sex marriage offer for many years , as well as another , banning burning the flag .
as or sought to members of congress to propose amendments , they are not faster than in past years .

entirely different experiences illustrate the uneasy relationship that developed between the army and often indifferent , sometimes in us audience .
" we are not victims , " said brigadier general sean b. mcfarland , who commanded the forces in iraq , and soon went to afghanistan .
this is a very sensitive topic for commanders , who do not want to seem ungrateful or objecting with society , which they serve .
as a result , most talk about the pity is quietly and only between combat veterans .
some will look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and were in exotic places .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible for work in washington immediately after the military campaign .
uneasy , that have the military , partly comes from the us indifference to the wars .
" we , as the nation , no longer appreciate military heroism , as it was quite usually in world war ii , " says david бэрноу , retired lieutenant - general who commanded the american forces in afghanistan .

its strategy : instead , to collect all of the plaintiffs in this case , put all your eggs in one basket , so to speak , " she will open up many things , if necessary , to maintain the pressure .
court documents , which was newsweek , the strategy is basically a protection that the former or current soldiers cannot claims to the army for damage incurred by in the armed forces .
" the supposed damage refers to risk , присущему military service , of the plaintiffs , " said the documents .
and in iraq and afghanistan women 's team - soldiers play an increasingly important role , especially in contacts with local women in combat zone .

between them and the verdict stands the doctrine , which criticized since then , as it appeared .
army lagged for decades , because it does not have those incentives and restraining funds , which imposes responsibility .
these things will change only to back then , when good people will want to to fight .
" we will continue to fight the army on the issue , until the reforms , " she says .
on monday , breivik , suspected of committing mass killings in norway in july , which has killed 77 people , was on his first open the hearing .
after the summer of the tragedy the researchers wanted to to learn more about these people .
supply of personal data on facebook is so great , " says bartlett , the researchers could easily use the site 's advertising tool , to highlight the demographic group with scientific precision - that marketers and for several years already .
with facebook bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants 14 extreme right - wing parties in 11 european countries - not even out of office .
some results are not so striking : online - supporters of right - wing groups - often young and male , dissatisfied with the immigration .
work demos - just one example of how facebook became a new popular tool in the hands of researchers .
with more than 800 million active users , add an average of three records in the day , " super - hot information " facebook is research boom , increasing the number of scientific papers with the name of the site in the title on the 800 % over the past five years .
" before , if you want to interview people from the british national party , would have been very difficult to identify them . "
" facebook does this is all - you to contact him directly . "
recent research by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on facebook , were much more at risk for alcoholism , than students who were silent on this issue .
" you ca n't solve the problem , not выявив its , " told the washington post димитри христакис moreno , co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development in children 's research institute for seattle .
facebook also constantly pulls all sorts of data about its users .
but facebook users know that the site is watching them , like it or not - for the opportunity to play in скраббл with another , in thousands of miles away from you , the site can handle your personal data .
while researchers have a strictly defined rules for offline - research , online data .
" as far as they imagined , it was only between them and their friends . "
even offline there is no guarantee that the object research very honest .
" what you say on facebook , and the fact that you do outside of facebook , " two completely different things , " said selwin .
" nothing can replace exit in the real world , and interacting with real people , " he says .
" cold and inhuman " : anders беринг breivik for the first time publicly appears before court

about 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i became a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea that he is part of the " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he is not mad , and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices .
but it is not decreases automatically grief and confusion , which now feels the entire nation .
after the death of steve jobs on 5 october some compared him with henry ford , describing the technical genius as a great inventor of modernity .
he was , of course , a designer , мечтателем and regarded themselves as hippies , but he was also meticulous organizer and modernizer manufacturing process , which believed that many business leaders have suffered from the disease to think that really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] a great idea from the great product separates a huge amount of ingenious labor . "
by the time it took about 10 years since , as jobs from apple , and he already worked out in his new computer company next in anticipation of the mass of the internet .
only after the death of jobs full vhs - copy has been found in the garage of the director .
man known for their hatred of detailed interview , jobs seems to be here unusually prepared to present their technological philosophy and business strategy .
in four different points during the interview there are large intervals between questions and answers - reflection for 10-15 seconds , where jobs are clearly weighing its thoughts to say .
in filmed before the age of пиксара , айподов and айфонов lost interview there is something uncannily prophetic , when jobs estimates that , as he sees , different companies make right and wrong , and offers its own vision for information technology .
he has a vision of how things could and should be .
" during the entire time in the business i constantly asked : " why do you do it ? " and the answers that you invariably get : " oh , it 's just done exactly that . "
by way of recording expenses , often начинавшейся expenditure with the " standard " , which took from the ceiling and then подгонялись with " clarification " , he has created automated structure , which guaranteed that they will be able to track business expenses until the little things .
jobs in detail about " blue box , " which he fewer with steve wozniak , the device , which allowed people to effectively взламывать telephone company and call on the long distances for free .
he says , as he and wozniak tested the box , using the phone - machine gun , when the conversation and then подсоединяясь from one at&t 's network to another , not yet been as much as possible .
" we were young , and all that we have learned is that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
jobs continues to describe one famous escapade , in detail with which he and wozniak almost did , calling the vatican through blue box at midnight and asking to phone the pope , struggling to copy henry kissinger .
about love in the technology ( and cold прозванивании bill хьюлетта ) :
soon after their 20 - minute telephone conversation jobs received a year подработку in hewlett - пакард .
jobs later became one of the hp employees , who visited the company 's research laboratory in palo alto , where he saw " the first desktop computer . "
i often went to the hp as a teenager and revolved around the machine and wrote for her program .
in several places in an interview with jobs says about inventing new products on the fly .
working only 30 days in the credit , he had to think and assembly and delivery of ready - made devices .
" i remember the fierce debate ... they were shouting at me , that it will take five years [ to collect the mouse , which will cost $ 300 ] , and i was fed by the throat , and released , and found the designer " .
" for example , you 're working in ibm or xerox , so you do the best copier and printer , or that ? "
sales and marketing make it more successful , thus [ it is those types of people ] who finally comes to the management companies , and people , making the product of the decision - makers .
he could be ten times more , could be майкрософтом 1990s ...
you need to keep in the head of the 5,000 of ideas - these concepts , " combining them all together ... "
part of what made the famous mac , was that people who worked on him , were musicians , poets , artists , зоологами , historians , who happened to be the best specialists in information technology in the world .
scalia and thomas lunch with the opponents of the health care law , until the court consider the case
this incident took place in the last thursday , when all nine justices met to discuss filed petitions for review .
judges agreed to consider the process ; in fact , rotary debate lasting in the 5 1/2 hours are expected in march 2012 , and the outcome will likely become a hindrance in the presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time , when a court decision .
law firm clement , bancroft pllc , was one of almost two dozen firms , which helped sponsor an annual dinner of federalists , long - existing groups , constantly , conservative legal principles .
another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
was present , among other things , mitch mcconnell , the leader of the republicans in the senate and a well - known opponent of the health care law .
nothing new : two judges visit events company federalists have already been for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as the company with large financial interests , it was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign to raise money with lawyers , which are now viewed in court . "

" asia it can be to some extent is protected , but it may not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and reducing foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and to civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , make such a strong decline , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction of unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" although the military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will become the fastest decline in the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with whom we can live , and this is not an option , that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for release of the pentagon from cuts , will see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be further -- troops with a shell , but without the core .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles , including those which passed the tests , and some only in the early stages of planning .
stop further development and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that it was a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
the administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly made that retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign related to укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud on the exams in a school and college - standard thing .
mentors , who should teach the opposite , sends a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
during one of the day , studies have shown that , you may lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth it from this draw the conclusion that liars difficult to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change their position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when responding to a complex question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means , to expose the lies , but to master the skill to detect deception can be .

insee , despite this , to reduce the numbers in the second quarter , with the fall of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation .
germany , in turn , the growth of 0.5 % for the same period .
if there is a topic that the decision which cannot be taken after a short discussion or by emotions , so it 's energy policy .
this healthy trend that the election meetings are an occasion for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france should build their opinion on the objective facts and rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete fossil resources to continue electricity production is growing deficit , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany is one of its decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is just a few of those who resolutely keeps his projects .
while the german model based on renewable energy , sometimes for example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than average in europe .
as the price of energy is a key factor in a globalized economy competitiveness and service of industrial equipment in the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized in international trade in small and medium sized enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry .
one engineer and electrician would order epr , calculated to sixty years , if a planned closure of its maker ?
areva solutions with low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , shows взаимодополнимости .
in france we have the security , which monitors energy centers , too , and transparent , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has three serious incidents .
in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .
the nuclear industry benefit from this accident , learned from previous two .
as it is all specialists in the field of energy to build a reactor , will halt its construction in фламанвиле magnificent gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to conquer leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when interior minister ( либерасьон " from france on may 23 , said that " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of the immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially skilled , provoking declining wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and most skilled , dynamic sectors , where training not related to the proposals .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local that the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and without taking into account the fact that this diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates high proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all founded immigrants ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in a german immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs an average of 150,000 euros .
the teeth , which used to scare immigrants , have exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but also fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , a vote and make it as straight as possible .
universal vote , though it is essential to democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a tool of repression " , as republican once philosopher etienne вашро .
