at a hearing in the city council last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said the layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 , said that they have notice of claim , warning department of education that against him filed ; on wednesday , will be held a press conference to announce a formal file a lawsuit in state supreme court in manhattan .

language may sound harmless , but still no discussion on the libya 's was easy .

this measure , proposed a member of the house of representatives bob гудлатом ( republican , virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other , which will be on the plenary vote in congress this convocation .
amendment гудлата is only one of 68 constitutional amendments , affect a wide range of issues , which were introduced in this meeting .

the budget control act , which passed in august , demanded that and the house of representatives and the senate vote for a balanced budget amendment .

amendment banning same - sex marriage offer for many years , and another , as banning flag - burning .

some would look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and have been to exotic places .
still looking for work , he said , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible work in washington immediately after combat tour .
awkwardness , that are military , in part , comes from the american indifference to the wars .

court documents , which got newsweek , the strategy - basically a protection that the current or former soldiers cannot claims for damages incurred by the army in the armed forces .
" the alleged damage refers to risk присущему military service of the plaintiffs , " in the documents said .

" we will continue to fight the army on this issue until will reform , " she says .
on monday , breivik , suspected of committing mass murder in norway in july , which has 77 people dead , appeared at his first public court hearing .
following summer tragedy , researchers want to find out more about these people .
hoard of personal data on facebook is so great , " says bartlett , the researchers could easily use the site 's advertising tool , to highlight the demographic group with scientific precision - that marketers and do for several years .
using facebook bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants of the 14 extreme - right parties in 11 european countries are not even leaving the office .
some of the results are not so striking : online supporters of right - wing groups - often young people , male , disaffected immigration .
demos 's work just one example of how facebook becomes a new popular as a tool in the hands of scientists .
with more than 800 million active users , add an average of three record in the day , " the super - hot information " facebook causes research boom , increasing number of scientific papers with the name of the site in the title by 800 % over the past five years .
" before , and if you want to interview people from the british national party , it would be very hard to identify them . "
" facebook does all that " you get to them directly . "
recent study by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on facebook , were much more at risk for alcoholism than students who were silent on this issue .
" you ca n't solve the problem , not выявив it , " the washington post said димитри христакис moreno , the co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development at the seattle children 's research institute .
facebook also has constantly draws a different type of data about his own users .
but facebook users know that the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - for the opportunity to play in the скраббл other , in thousands of miles away from you , the site can handle your personal data .
while researchers have a strictly defined standards conducting offline - for research , online data .

even offline there 's no guarantee that a research dead honest .
" what you say on facebook , and what you do outside of facebook , are two completely different things , " says the selwin .
" nothing can replace exit into the real world and fellowship with real people , " he said .
" cold and inhuman " : anders беринг breivik is first publicly tried

around 30 survivors and victims ' relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but me personally was a little bit easier , after i saw and heard suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea that he is part of a big " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he was not crazy , and said that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices .
but that does n't automatically reduces grief and confusion , that now feels the entire nation .

it has a vision for how things could be and would have to be .
" throughout the entire time in the business i constantly asked : " why do you do this ? " and the answers you invariably get : " oh , it 's just done it . "
by way of recording costs , often начинавшейся with " standard spending " that took from the ceiling and then подгонялись with " clarification " , he has created automated structure , which ensured that they will be able to track business expenses until the details .

" we were young , and all that we learned is that we could build something , that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
jobs continues to describe one famous escapade , in detail with which he and wozniak almost did , calling the vatican through the blue box in the midnight and asking to phone the pope , struggling to copy henry kissinger .
about the love of technology ( and cold прозванивании bill хьюлетта ) :
jobs soon after their 20 - minute phone conversation was summer подработку at hewlett - пакард .

, the pri ruled mexico for seven decades until lost the presidency in year 2000 .

раджат naga , the managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must " do everything they can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia it can be protected to some extent , but it cannot be immune . "
the monetary union was badly undermined europe 's debt crisis in the past months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis spawned fears that he can bring the global economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's commerce minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and a reduction in foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious challenges , and we need to maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that developing economies like india makes no sense to help wealthy europeans , when they face from their own deep economic problems .
" at some point , they know that the greeks are retiring in 50 years to come and go on holidays to the sea , and it wo n't be seen well , " he said .
mr. knag says that the eurozone crisis threatened by " significant direct consequences " across asia .
he said that vulnerable emerging markets need to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from the downturn and significant capital оттоков out of their economies .
defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the impact of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona , and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , would make such a strong reduction , the majority of our projects кораблестроению and construction of unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine trust with those who supports our army and will seriously damage combat readiness " .
" while the military funding in the overseas contingency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff personnel will be reduced , leading to опозданиям with the payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will be quick decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not a solution , which we can live with , and it is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or the recent warnings from senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for release of the pentagon from reductions that will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with a shell , but without kernel .
" it 's a paper tiger , army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks at the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles , including those who have already been testing and some only early stages of planning .
stopping further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that is a vital next step to improve and confront potential threats china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lie in daily life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged with лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly hide that a retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged with in the financial fraud during the campaign , connected to укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors , which must be taught the opposite , sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
in a day , as studies show that , you may lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that total strangers солгали nearly three times in the first 10 minutes of contact with each other .
in contrast to the game room , similar to , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to detect lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
should not to conclude from this that liars difficult to see and difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , exploring the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which can easily learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or governance .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , while women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lie to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe per asphyxia , laugh , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , or change their position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a difficult issue entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering a difficult question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... how much i know . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lies , but the skill detecting deception can be .

in his lectures technological view of the pits , read as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover its typical вязкоупругое behavior .
this means that resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes in during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in chemical engineering .
among the most of the upper layers is bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
with the movement vehicles and latch effort , it helps forces very well be on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом cover , he added , placed the last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made of small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .

as it is all the specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration burden to the french economy and for the french society .
in his program francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of influence of immigrants based on the view that they can replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking reduction in wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most skilled - dynamic sectors , where training is not linked to offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants , leads that the arrival of the immigrants positively affect the salaries of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all based immigrants ) .
according to the world labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their foes , enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a necessary condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once philosopher etienne said вашро .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first of all this political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we are dreaming not edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with it each of its nations .
because only joint work europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt each , free from markets and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a long discussion of this proposal socialists and jacques delors now require all european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , was to " create a " republicans .
this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , this popular eu sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 will be completed 11 % sales growth of the world microprocessors ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million .
this year in the world will be sold 460 million бесконтактных chip cards against 320 million a year earlier .
europe , for a long time lagged from the asia - pacific region , is now moving forward in the field of бесконтактных payments .
france starts off with more modest positions : in circulation are 400,000 бесконтактных visa cards .
this year the carrefour released a 2.5 million бесконтактных pass mastercard .
" two large organisations in france promised in the future systematically to distribute among their clients ' bank cards , suited for non - use , " said gerard небуи , general manager of visa europe france .
but this is only the first stage of development in the future means of payment , there is a mobile phone .
" we count on global sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , " explains mark бертен , head of eurosmart .
yesterday , crédit agricole announced the experiment from december to june next year in the massacre .
confirmed long предполагавшиеся link between the terrorist group al qaeda in the muslim maghreb ( aqmi ) and nigerian sect boko haram .
" the way in which use these two organizations , and intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperate , " he explained , without going into the details .
among the wreckage left after the operation , french and нигерские investigators found a few phone sim card , belonging to terrorists .
analysis of the calls pointed to several interlocutors , were in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but , certainly , you have to wait for more reliable evidence , before talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by the washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the problems that creates a boko haram .
it focused mainly on the church , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas , she took responsibility for per share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja .
in august , local representation of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when aqmi has in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram is a new threat to continent .
whether weakened by crisis america can lead a complex world with the help of the simple , or rather simplistic ideas ?
for a few days , mitt romney , the distance kain , rick perry and others множат loud , but without details statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally strong republicans .
mitt romney , who has the best chances of nomination from the " good old party " , has threatened to sue chinese complaint in the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive issue for america , irritated migration for their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the difficult foreign policy , could not overcome position which indulging emotions .
but huntsman , who is at the bottom of the ratings , remained неуслышанным .
romney also promised military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to stop its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates showed daunting ignorance of affairs .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and to the military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
it is very far from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they resemble that obama himself was amateur , and that he had to lower the tone about the fight against terror .
after iraq , it does not believe in military intervention , which confused in the sand .
northern stream , new gate for entering of russian gas to europe .
he is designed on the supplies of natural gas the equivalent of 30 million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and government participated in the last tuesday on the shores of the baltic sea , between orchestra and exquisite performance snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , new pipeline , which directly connects russia and germany under water .
on the new pipeline 27.5 million of additional cubic metres of gas will come every year in western europe for the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region with the earth mecklenburg - western pomerania .
and the possibility of construction the third pipeline at the same direction have already been discussed .
these two countries will lose part of its power : they will be harder to influence russia , threatening to shut down access to western european markets .

" this pipeline is part of cooperation with russia , this is a new artery that connects us organically , " said francois fillon , opening the gas pipeline , showing the extent to which large gas contracts are important and politically and economically .

сигароообразный apparatus is inside a 1 - meter diameter pipeline and presses forward flow of gas .
gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for any repairs .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the northern flow , which has been commissioned to build and operate gas pipeline .
then gazprom gave this company to rent on twenty years with the possibility of extension of the entire volume of gas transportation .
gas pipeline construction financing was provided by 30 % shareholders and 70 % of bank loans .
gas pipeline out of the baltic sea in lubmin on a sandy beach , mulberry coniferous trees .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before sucked him in the german gas pipelines .
at full capacity it will be 3 million per hour , and 6 million in 2012 .
